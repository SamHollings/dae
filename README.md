# DAE - helpful code
This is my own personal library of code which I have found useful when working in 
DAE, and which I'd like to share with other people. 

This not an "official" NHS Digital github account, and the code will not necessarily
work for you out of the box.

### Manifest:
- **spark_tools**: ths is more for testing offline out of DAE as it allows you to create a spark instance on your computer
- **hes_all_years**: this contains functions to combine the many HES financial years tables into one DELTA LAKE table
- **download**: this contains utility functions to help with donwloads within DAE
